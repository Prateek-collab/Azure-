Azure
The Weather App (Python GUI)
This here is a basic GUI developed by python module tkinter.
The application fetches the zip code from the user and displays the current weather report on screen via an API.

Commit1 - Basic GUI setup with the essential buttons packed onto the window.
Commit2 - Color Meter added. A mechanism where the air quality decides the background color of the window.
Commit3 - Lookup Form added. A box to enter desired zipcode rather than using hardcoded zipcodes.

Thus, Azure Weather Application accepts the zipcode from the user and returns the air qaulity and the air quality index with a color notation.
